# review on matrix monitoring and sketching and its application on frequent pattern recognition and anomaly detection

In this study, we intend to explore the concept of streaming data and its storage and data mining methods such as frequent pattern mining, association rules, and anomaly detection. First, we review the basic concepts and previous studies on these topics or related topics such as compression, etc., then we discuss various methods in this area, and finally, we review these methods together in terms of statistics, performance against anomaly detection, etc.
